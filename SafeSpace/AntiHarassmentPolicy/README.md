<h1>Code for ABQ's Anti-Harassment Policy</h1>

<p>This anti-harassment policy is based on the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">example policy</a> from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.

<p>This policy is based on several other policies, including the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work.

<p>----------

<p>All Code for ABQ network activities, events, and digital forums and their staff, presenters, and participants are held to an anti-harassment policy, included below.

<p>In addition to governing our own events by this policy, Code for ABQ will only lend our brand and fund groups that offer an anti-harassment policy to their attendees. For information on how to offer an anti-harassment policy to your group, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zg2FDt7awgfCmdcbzMwKHMb1A7KDOhs_z7ibCb3TLLQ/edit">this guide.<a>

<p>Code for ABQ is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of core members, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Code for ABQ event or network activity, including talks. Anyone in violation of these policies may expelled from Code for ABQ network activities, events, and digital forums, at the discretion of the event organizer or forum administrator.

<p>Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing language or action.

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Code for ABQ network activities, events, and digital forums. 

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a core member of Code for ABQ immediately. You can contact them at safespace@codeforamerica.org or use our Harassment Reporter. Core members will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

<p>If you cannot reach an event organizer or forum administrator and/or it is an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove yourself from the situation. 

<p>You can also contact Code for America about harassment at safespace@codeforamerica.org and feel free to use the email template below. Code for America staff acknowledge that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation due to the number of events and the fact that our team is not always present. However, we are hopeful that by providing these guidelines we are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an environment that is welcoming to all.

<p>We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.
